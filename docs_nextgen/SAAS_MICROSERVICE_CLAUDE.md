# SaaS Microservice Development Framework

This document provides business-agnostic patterns for building multi-tenant SaaS platforms using Go + NATS microservices. This guidance focuses on SaaS-specific concerns independent of domain logic.

## Multi-Tenancy Architecture Patterns

### Tenant Isolation Strategies

#### Data Isolation Approaches
- **Database per Tenant**: Complete isolation, higher operational overhead
- **Schema per Tenant**: Logical separation, moderate complexity  
- **Shared Database with Tenant ID**: Efficient resources, requires careful design
- **Hybrid Approach**: Critical data isolated, non-sensitive data shared

#### Message Isolation Patterns
- **Tenant-Scoped Subjects**: `tenant.{tenantId}.service.action`
- **Multi-Tenant Queues**: Queue groups with tenant filtering
- **Tenant-Aware Routing**: Message routing based on tenant context
- **Resource Quotas**: Per-tenant message rate limiting

### Tenant Context Management

#### Context Propagation
- Tenant ID in message headers for all inter-service communication
- Request context carries tenant information through call chains
- Authentication middleware extracts and validates tenant access
- Circuit breakers and rate limiting applied per tenant

#### Tenant Configuration
- Per-tenant feature flags and configuration overrides
- Tenant-specific business rules and workflows
- Resource limits and quota management
- Custom branding and localization support

## SaaS API Design Patterns

### RESTful Service Design

#### Resource Modeling
- Tenant-scoped resource paths: `/api/v1/tenants/{tenantId}/resources`
- Hierarchical resource relationships with proper nesting
- Consistent resource naming conventions across services
- Version management for backward compatibility

#### Pagination and Filtering  
- Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- Field selection to minimize payload sizes
- Complex filtering with query parameter standards
- Sorting with performance considerations

#### Error Handling Standards
- Consistent error response formats across services
- Tenant-aware error messages and localization
- Proper HTTP status codes for different error types
- Error correlation IDs for distributed debugging

### Event-Driven Architecture

#### Domain Event Design
- Events represent business facts, not system events
- Rich events with sufficient context to avoid additional service calls
- Event versioning strategy for schema evolution
- Tenant context included in all domain events

#### Event Sourcing Patterns
- Aggregate root design for consistency boundaries
- Event store per tenant or shared with tenant partitioning
- Snapshot strategies for performance optimization
- Replay capabilities for tenant data recovery

#### Saga Pattern Implementation
- Orchestration vs choreography trade-offs for complex workflows
- Compensation actions for distributed transaction rollback
- Timeout handling for long-running business processes
- Tenant-aware saga state management

## Data Architecture Patterns

### Entity Design Principles

#### Common Entity Attributes
- Tenant ID as foreign key in all tenant-scoped entities
- Audit fields: created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by
- Soft delete support with deleted_at timestamps
- Version fields for optimistic locking
- UUID primary keys for distributed systems

#### Data Relationships
- Tenant boundaries prevent cross-tenant data relationships
- Reference data shared across tenants vs tenant-specific
- Hierarchical data structures within tenant scope
- Data archival strategies for compliance and performance

### Database Design Patterns

#### Schema Evolution
- Migration scripts compatible with multi-tenant deployment
- Zero-downtime schema changes with backward compatibility
- Tenant-specific schema customizations when necessary
- Data type selection for performance and storage efficiency

#### Performance Optimization
- Indexing strategies considering tenant partitioning
- Query patterns optimized for tenant-scoped operations
- Connection pooling with tenant-aware distribution
- Caching strategies with tenant context

## Security Architecture

### Authentication and Authorization

#### Identity Management
- Multi-tenant identity provider integration
- Service-to-service authentication with scoped tokens
- API key management for external integrations
- Session management with tenant context

#### Authorization Patterns
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within tenant scope
- Resource-based permissions for fine-grained access
- Tenant administrator roles and capabilities
- Cross-service authorization token propagation

### Data Security

#### Encryption Strategies
- Data at rest encryption with tenant-specific keys
- Message payload encryption for sensitive data
- TLS for all inter-service communication
- Key rotation policies and procedures

#### Privacy and Compliance
- Data residency requirements by tenant
- Personal data handling and anonymization
- Audit logging for compliance requirements
- Data retention and purging policies

## Observability Patterns

### Monitoring and Metrics

#### Business Metrics
- Tenant-specific usage and performance metrics
- Service-level agreement (SLA) monitoring per tenant
- Business KPI tracking across tenant boundaries
- Cost attribution and resource utilization by tenant

#### System Metrics
- Service health and availability monitoring
- Message queue depth and processing latency
- Database performance per tenant partition
- Infrastructure resource utilization

### Logging and Tracing

#### Structured Logging
- Tenant ID in all log entries for filtering
- Correlation IDs for request tracing across services
- Business event logging for audit trails
- Error classification and severity levels

#### Distributed Tracing
- Request flow visualization across service boundaries
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Tenant-specific performance analysis
- Integration point monitoring

## DevOps and Operational Patterns

### Deployment Strategies

#### Service Deployment
- Independent service deployments without tenant downtime
- Feature flag management for gradual rollouts
- Blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates
- Rollback procedures and health checks

#### Configuration Management
- Environment-specific configuration with tenant overrides
- Secret management with tenant-scoped access
- Feature flag management per tenant
- Configuration validation and change management

### Scaling Patterns

#### Horizontal Scaling
- Auto-scaling based on tenant load patterns
- Load balancing with tenant affinity when needed
- Queue scaling based on message volume
- Database scaling strategies per tenant tier

#### Resource Management
- Resource quotas and throttling per tenant
- Cost optimization through resource sharing
- Performance isolation between tenant tiers
- Capacity planning for tenant growth

## Integration Patterns

### External Service Integration

#### Third-Party APIs
- Tenant-specific API credentials and configuration
- Rate limiting and circuit breakers per integration
- Data synchronization patterns with external systems
- Webhook handling with tenant context

#### Message Broker Integration
- External message broker connectivity patterns
- Message transformation and routing
- Dead letter queue handling for failed integrations
- Monitoring and alerting for integration health

### Internal Service Communication

#### Synchronous Communication
- Service discovery with health checking
- Load balancing and failover strategies
- Timeout and retry policies
- Request/response correlation

#### Asynchronous Communication  
- Event publishing with guaranteed delivery
- Event subscription and handler patterns
- Message ordering and deduplication
- Backpressure and flow control

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Multi-Tenancy Anti-Patterns
- Tenant data leakage through shared resources
- Hard-coded tenant assumptions in business logic
- Cross-tenant operations without proper authorization
- Tenant-specific code paths instead of configuration

### Performance Anti-Patterns
- N+1 queries in tenant-scoped operations
- Missing indexes on tenant ID columns
- Synchronous calls where async would be appropriate
- Resource sharing without proper isolation

### Security Anti-Patterns
- Tenant ID manipulation in client applications
- Missing authorization checks in service APIs
- Sensitive data in log files or messages
- Hard-coded credentials or tokens

This framework provides the foundation for building robust, scalable, and secure SaaS platforms while remaining domain-agnostic for specific business use cases.
